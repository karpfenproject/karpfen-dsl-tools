/**
 * Recognizes the ids by which documentation might refer to other documents instead of naming what it means.
 *
 * A reader of the code should not have to look up an id to understand a sentence, so documentation names the thing in
 * words, for example "the decision that the readers never throw" instead of the number of that decision. The ids
 * recognized here are those that planning documents and reviews use:
 *
 * - a section sign followed by a section number;
 * - the word "section" followed by a section number, also after "spec" or "specification", in any case, and the
 *   abbreviations "sec." and "sect." followed by a number;
 * - the word "decision" followed by a number, in any case and also in the plural, and the word "record", also after
 *   "decision", followed by a number;
 * - a numbered rule, step or item of a document: the word and its number followed by "of the" and the name of a plan,
 *   proposal, specification or record, with up to three words in between, or after the possessive of such a document;
 * - a work-package id: the letters WP followed by a hyphen and a name in letters, or by a number with or without a
 *   hyphen, and the words "work package" followed by a name in capitals or by a number;
 * - the abbreviation ADR followed by a number, with or without a blank, hyphen or underscore in between;
 * - the words "review round" followed by a number, and the key of a review finding, words joined by hyphens, quoted
 *   or in backticks after the word "review" or after a round, or after the words "review finding" also unquoted;
 * - a short key, the capital letter D, E or P followed by a number, as planning documents name decisions, findings
 *   and phases, where the text uses it as a reference: after or before the word decision, finding or phase, after the
 *   word key, alone or in a list in parentheses, or followed by a colon.
 *
 * Ordinary prose does not match: a short key standing alone, such as a function key or the diagram language D2, a
 * capital D with a digit inside a longer word, the word "decision" without a number, a numbered step of an algorithm
 * without a document, and the codes of diagnostics without the word review.
